## tl;dr

EventBridge Scheduler is a new feature within the EventBridge suite of tools, designed to
specifically handle those cases where a scheduled EventBridge Rule used to be used. If you would
normally reach for the `rate(...)` or `cron(...)` expressions with an EventBridge Rule, you should
be taking a look at EventBridge Scheduler. It has a much wider feature set and some real quality of
life improvements.

## A closer look

There are 4 key sections within EventBridge Scheduler that I want to take a look at today. These are:
timezone support; flexible time windows; SDK integration; point-in-time events.

### Timezones

Let's get started with timezone support. It's fair to say I was pretty excited when this got
announced. Any developer who says they've never faced issues with managing timezones, especially
when daylight savings time gets into the mix - is probably being less than truthful.

EventBridge Scheduler supports the ability to choose what timezone you would like your schedules to
run on. This could be something like `Europe/London`, or you can still use `UTC` if that's what your
application is designed for. We do love backwards compatibility!

This addition means that when a schedule is defined for 8am every day via a Cron expression, if you
set the timezone to something other than `UTC` then it'll automatically be adjusted when the clocks
change in the Autumn and Spring. Useful indeed.

### Flexible time windows

Flexible time windows are an easy way to add variance to the time that a scheduled action takes
place. This is especially useful if you have lots of actions scheduled for the same time that all
rely on the same downstream resource.

For example, imagine an application where a users are subscribed to a newsletter after they've
signed up for an account. An EventBridge Schedule is set up to send this email. The service
that's being used to send the emails is rate limited. Using flexible time windows, we can add
15 mins, 30 mins, 1 hour, 2 hours or 4 hours variance to the scheduled action time to spread out
the execution of events and avoid exceeding rate limits.

### SDK integration

This is another really nice addition to EventBridge's features. AWS call this "Universal targets".
Ultimately, this means that the vast majority of actions supported by the AWS API are now able to be
directly invoked by an EventBridge Schedule. For example, `arn:aws:scheduler:::aws-sdk:glue:startJobRun`
could be set as a target for a schedule.

I'm all for any efforts to reduce the amount of 'glue code' that needs to be written in order to
join up multiple AWS services.

### Point-in-time events

The final part of EventBridge Scheduler that I wanted to highlight was the ability to create one-off
point in time schedules.

Previously, there was no way with EventBridge to trigger actions at a given point in time, just on a
recurring basis. There was a common pattern which involved using DynamoDB's item TTL functionality
in combination with DynamoDB streams - however there were drawbacks with this around the precision of
TTL as well as the increased burden on maintaining another system in your overall architecture.

One-off schedules are implemented via the `at(...)` expression, joining `cron` and `rate`. This type
of event lends itself naturally to per-user events which raises the question of whether it's
scalable enough to support this use-case. Good news on that front! By default, there's a quota of
1 million schedules per account, but this is adjustable.

One point to take note of is that after a one-off event has run, it doesn't automatically delete.
This means that some manual tidying up will be required over time. The [ListSchedules](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/scheduler/latest/APIReference/API_ListSchedules.html)
API does return a `State` property that can be either `ENABLED` or `DISABLED` - I'm curious to see
whether this can indicate an already actioned one-off event to help automation of tidying up.

## Summary

In summary, EventBridge Scheduler is a great improvement on the standard EventBridge scheduled rules
and adds some much needed features.
