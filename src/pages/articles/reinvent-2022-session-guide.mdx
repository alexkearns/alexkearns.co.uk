I'm lucky enough to be attending re:Invent 2022 this year and as reservations for the sessions open later today (Tues 11 Oct 2022 6pm BST), I thought I would follow others and produce a guide of those sessions that I think are the most valuable. There are so many sessions that I'd love to see, but only so much time in the day.

This guide is closely aligned wih my interests in serverless, event driven architectures and general AWS best practices. That does mean that it might not quite fit with what you want to get out of re:Invent. If you're catching up with this guide after all the reservation slots have gone, not to worry - there is usually space for walk-up attendees. Session descriptions are all taken verbatim from the re:Invent session catalog.

## Monday 28th Nov

### API311: Building next-gen applications with event-driven architectures [300]
- 10:00 AM - 11:00 AM
- Level 1, Lafite 5, Wynn
- Breakout Session

*Speakers*
- TBA

Event-driven architectures can solve many difficult problems in modern enterprise workloads. For example, it can be challenging to work with large amounts of data in different data stores and locations. Teams building microservices architecture often find that integration with other applications and external services can make their workloads more monolithic and tightly coupled. In this chalk talk, learn how to use event-based architecture to decouple and decentralize application components. Discover how you can use AWS messaging services to connect microservices and coordinate data flow using minimal custom code.

### API313: Understanding design in event-driven architecture [300]

*Speakers*
- David Boyne, Senior Developer Advocate, AWS

Event-driven applications can help you to reduce coupling and increase agility. The design and contracts of your events shape how your distributed architecture is built and determine how it can best remain decoupled, scalable, and fault tolerant. In this chalk talk, learn a robust approach to event design, common event patterns used, the importance of event-first thinking, and how event designation can impact your architecture.

Updated with recent learning, this session dives deep into building and improvising resilience in AWS services. Every AWS service is designed to be highly available, but a small number of what are called Tier 0 services get extra-special attention. In this session, hear lessons from how AWS has built and architected Amazon Route 53 and the AWS authentication system to help them survive cataclysmic failures, enormous load increases, and more. Learn about the AWS approach to redundancy and resilience at the infrastructure, software, and team levels and how the teams tasked with keeping the internet running manage themselves and keep up with the pace of change that AWS customers demand.

On December 9, 2021, there was a report of a potential remote code execution issue in the widely used open-source Apache logging library Log4j. This issue allowed a user to use Java Naming and Directory Interface (JNDI) and LDAP endpoints to execute arbitrary code on a system. Over the next 10 days, 5 additional common vulnerabilities and exposures affecting Log4j were made public. This event as is now referred to as Log4Shell. In this session, learn about the response to Log4Shell, from initial notification to hot patch, fleet scanning, and customer communications.
