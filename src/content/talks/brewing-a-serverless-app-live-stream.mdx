I've delivered talks for Norfolk Developers before, however wanted to try out a new format. They offer a format where a
raw, relatively unprepared live stream is delivered once a week for around 4 weeks.

Live streams are a format I've never explored before but have certainly been on my radar. I like the idea of an
audience seeing exactly how something is built in realtime, down to how the speaker approaches it in their own way.

Sticking with the serverless theme that I'd delivered before to a Norfolk Developers audience, I decided to live stream
the building of a simple web application using React as a front-end (very much not my specialty, you've been warned!)
and a Python backend making use of AWS serverless services such as Lambda functions, API Gateway and DynamoDB.

Catch the recordings of each of the streams on YouTube [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLc8-tQY65nvVLAKiHuLLyQxnw7dgNxJ43).
