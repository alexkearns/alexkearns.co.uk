Norfolk Developers were kind enough to let me talk to their community all about serverless, particularly on AWS. 
What I really wanted viewers to get from this talk was an understanding of what serverless really was, bust some of the common myths, talk through
why it's a good choice of architecture (and why it isn't always) as well as just how a developer can get started with it.

The talk was made up mostly of a live demo showcasing how straightforward it is to use the AWS SAM CLI to build a solution including API Gateway, 
Lambda, SQS and DynamoDB. You'll have to watch the talk to see how it went!

I think my favourite moment was the quote I heard at the end of the talk. Mission successful!
