I was lucky enough to be invited to speak to the OWASP Suffolk Chapter meetup all about the best practices of working
securely on AWS, focusing on easy wins for establishing solid security posture as well as making the most of AWS'
managed security services - a sure-fire way to take the load of a security professional new to cloud.

I really enjoyed to speaking about a different topic to that which I usually focus on. It was great to cater to some
people who've never used AWS before as well as those who are increasingly involved in it, but perhaps aren't fully up
to speed on how to apply their existing security knowledge.
