Hey! I'm Alex and I'm an all-round cloud geek. In work, out of work I love playing about with or talking about the cloud - AWS in particular. I'm especially interested in serverless solutions, bringing the ability to developers to get code deployed into the cloud without having to learn the ins and outs of server management.

For the day job, I work in the Solution Engineering practice at Inawisdom in Ipswich, UK. This involves designing and building AWS architectures to allow our clients to make best use of their data. Sometimes my role involves flexing into other practices such as Data Engineering. Definitely a challenge but always good to learn new things!
