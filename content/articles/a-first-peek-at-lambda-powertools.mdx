[AWS Lambda Powertools for Python](https://awslabs.github.io/aws-lambda-powertools-python/1.24.0/)
has been around publicly since the end of 2019 and reached General Availability
in June 2020. It's described as "A suite of utilities for AWS Lambda functions
to ease adopting best practices such as tracing, structured logging, custom
metrics, and more."

Within the community, this library has become almost a standard for serverless
projects and it is clear to see why. Over the past year the pace of features
being added has rocketed; it has certainly become one of my favourite tools to
have at my disposal when it comes to building serverless solutions on AWS.

In this post, we'll look at my five favourite features of Lambda Powertools and
how they can be used day-to-day to make development more efficient.

I'm deliberately not going to go into super detail on how to set up each of
these features - the documentation is very, very good and there's no need for me
to repeat it all!

All the features discussed below are consolidated into a demo application on
GitHub
[here](https://github.com/alexkearns/lambda-powertools-demo/tree/a1f7910f90ccc3a6136b844beee3f77124ee5d32).

## Tracer

The `Tracer` utility is a light wrapper on top of AWS X-Ray, a service used for
tracing requests through an application. Often these applications are
microservice architectures where one request might touch many services behind
the scenes. Having a way to debug where this request might've gone wrong along
the road is incredibly useful.

The code snippets below shows what needs to be added to the SAM template and
Lambda function Python script in order to get a minimal example up and running
for tracing with X-Ray.

```yaml
HelloWorldFunction:
  Type: AWS::Serverless::Function
  Properties:
    Tracing: Active
    Environment:
      Variables:
        POWERTOOLS_SERVICE_NAME: lambda-powertools-demo-hello-world
```

```python
from aws_lambda_powertools import Tracer

tracer = Tracer()


@tracer.capture_lambda_handler
def lambda_handler(event, context):
    return {
        "statusCode": 200,
        "body": json.dumps({
            "message": "hello world",
        }),
    }
```

Once requests start running through the function, X-Ray will generate traces
such as the one below.

## Logger

Next up, it's the `Logger` utility. We all know that logging in applications is
important for debugging purposes as well as general observability. Within AWS,
CloudWatch Logs is the obvious choice for log storage and searching. The
`Logger` tool in Powertools makes writing structured logs considerably easier.
When running a statement like `logger.info("foo")` the library will take care of
writing to CloudWatch in a consistent format to make searching easy.

The snippets below show the basic steps required to get logging hooked up within
your Lambda.

```yaml
HelloWorldFunction:
  Type: AWS::Serverless::Function
  Properties:
    Environment:
      Variables:
        POWERTOOLS_SERVICE_NAME: lambda-powertools-demo-hello-world
        LOG_LEVEL: INFO
```

```python
from aws_lambda_powertools import Logger

logger = Logger()


@logger.inject_lambda_context(log_event=True)
def lambda_handler(event, context):
    logger.info("Running Hello World function")
    return {
        "statusCode": 200,
        "body": json.dumps({
            "message": "hello world",
        }),
    }
```

The simple example above translates into a log stream like the following. You
can see that the Lambda function event and the `logger.info` call have been
written in a consistent format which makes it possible for us to query them
using CloudWatch Log Insights - a service built on top of CloudWatch Logs that
enables the understanding of logs through a structured query language.

## Event Source Data Classes

Event Source Data Classes are an understated favourite. They don't provide any
interaction with AWS services, but they do increase the efficiency of developing
event-driven applications.

They do this by providing documented, typed classes for a variety of events that
can trigger a Lambda function. This means that when developing against these
events, you don't need to spend all the time with your head in documentation
trying to figure out what parameters get sent and whether they are serialised or
not.

```python
import json
from aws_lambda_powertools import Logger
from aws_lambda_powertools.utilities.data_classes import (
    event_source,
    APIGatewayProxyEvent
)


logger = Logger()


@event_source(data_class=APIGatewayProxyEvent)
@logger.inject_lambda_context(log_event=True)
def lambda_handler(event: APIGatewayProxyEvent, context):
    logger.info(f"Method: {event.http_method}")
    logger.info(f"Path: {event.path}")

    return {
        "statusCode": 200,
        "body": json.dumps({
            "message": "hello world",
        }),
    }

```
