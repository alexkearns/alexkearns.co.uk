  A look at the new CloudFormation Fn::ForEach intrinsic function and how it
  compares to Terraform's capabilities.

## Introduction

It's been a while since I've published a blog post as I've been busy
experimenting with some new forms of content creation (i.e. Twitch) and settling
into my new job. I'm back now with a look at an exciting new feature to
CloudFormation, the `Fn::ForEach` intrinsic function.

## CloudFormation

For a long time, if you wanted to create multiple resources in CloudFormation
you'd need to define them all individually. For example, take a look at the
snippet below.

```yaml
Resources:
  BucketOne:
    Type: AWS::S3::Bucket
    Properties:
      BucketName: my-bucket-one
  BucketTwo:
    Type: AWS::S3::Bucket
    Properties:
      BucketName: my-bucket-two
```

Whilst there are of course advantages to this, the main one being that it's
incredibly explicit what resources are being created, it does introduce
repetitiveness and create inertia in the developer experience when lots of
similar resources need to be created.

Back in October 2021, the idea of an `Fn::Map` intrinsic function was proposed
[on GitHub here](https://github.com/aws-cloudformation/cfn-language-discussion/issues/41).
In May 2022, an official request for comment (RFC) was
[published by AWS](https://github.com/aws-cloudformation/cfn-language-discussion/pull/75)
attracting lots of thoughts and opinions from various members of the community.
It's great to see AWS taking input from end users into account when developing
new features. The time taken from the feature being marked as approved and it
being released for general availability was around a month. It's always
interesting to get a little insight to how AWS propose, plan and deliver
features.

The new `Fn::ForEach` intrinsic function was released on 26 July 2023
[here](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2023/07/accelerate-cloudformation-authoring-experience-looping-function/).
The way that it's described is "With Fn::ForEach, you can replicate parts of
your templates with minimal lines of code". Let's dive in and take a look at how
easy (or not) this really is.

First of all, it's important to note that this new function requires the
`AWS::LanguageExtensions` transform to be specified in the CloudFormation
template.

In it's simplest form, defining a mappable resource follows the pattern in the
snippet below. Each loop needs to have a unique name. This is represented by the
`{UniqueLoopName}` part of the example. Within the loop (represented as a list)
there are three items.

- Firstly, `{ValueIdentifier}` which is a string that defines the dynamic name
  that'll be later used for referencing the iterated over value (e.g.
  `BucketName`).
- The second item is the list itself that'll be iterated over.
- Finally, the last item is the resource (or resources) that should be created
  from the list defined. The syntax for defining these resources is exactly as
  per the normal CloudFormation resource specification with just a couple of
  differences. Rather than specifying a static logical resource name, such as
  `MyBucketOne`, you must use the dynamic reference name you specified to ensure
  all resources are created with unique names. In addition, you then have access
  to the value of the current item through the use of `!Ref {ValueIdentifier}`.

```yaml
AWSTemplateFormatVersion: 2010-09-09
Transform: 'AWS::LanguageExtensions'
Resources:
  Fn::ForEach::{UniqueLoopName}:
    - { ValueIdentifier }
    - [...]
    - Resource${ValueIdentifier}:
        Type: AWS::Service::Resource
        Properties:
          Property: !Ref { ValueIdentifier }
```

Let's move on to building a couple of examples in CloudFormation, followed by a
look at Terraform as an alternative.

### Example one

In this example, we're creating a couple of S3 buckets. This will create buckets
named `bucketone` and `buckettwo`, both at the logical level (within
CloudFormation) and the physical level (the bucket name).

This is the most simplistic example I could think of, but to me it presents a
problem. Typically CloudFormation logical names are CamelCase and S3 buckets can
only have lowercase characters in their physical names. As a result, we've had
to compromise on the logical name to meet the hard requirement imposed by the
physical name. Annoying, huh? Keep reading to see an alternative way.

```yaml
AWSTemplateFormatVersion: 2010-09-09
Transform: 'AWS::LanguageExtensions'
Resources:
  Fn::ForEach::Buckets:
    - BucketName
    - - bucketone
      - buckettwo
    - ${BucketName}:
        Type: AWS::S3::Bucket
        Properties:
          BucketName: !Ref BucketName
```

### Example two

In this example we're still building two S3 buckets, however this time we're
making use of CloudFormation's 'Mappings' functionality in order to retrieve
different values. Using the pattern below we can define values like `One` and
`Two` to identify our buckets, then link them to physical resource names of
`my-bucket-one` and `my-bucket-two` using the `Fn::FindInMap` intrinsic
function. Pretty nifty.

```yaml
AWSTemplateFormatVersion: 2010-09-09
Transform: 'AWS::LanguageExtensions'
Mappings:
  BucketMap:
    One:
      BucketName: my-bucket-one
	Two:
      BucketName: my-bucket-two
Resources:
  Fn::ForEach::Buckets:
    - BucketNumber
    - - One
      - Two
    - Bucket${BucketNumber}:
        Type: AWS::S3::Bucket
        Properties:
          BucketName:
			Fn::FindInMap: ["BucketMap", !Ref BucketNumber, "BucketName"]
```

## Terraform

I'm not going to spend too much time on Terraform mainly because the focus of
this article is the new functionality in CloudFormation, we'll take a look at
how it compares however.

At a high level, Terraform offers two features that are contenders to our
example usage `Fn::ForEach` intrinsic function. These are the `for_each` and
`count` meta arguments.

### `for_each`

The `for_each` meta argument is the closest match to CloudFormation's
`Fn::ForEach`. It takes a map or strings as input and then creates a resource
for each item.

In the example below, we define two bucket names as a set of strings and two
buckets as a map. From looking at the two resources, `aws_s3_bucket.buckets_set`
and `aws_s3_bucket.buckets_map` we can see that all that's required is
specifying `for_each` and `each.value` to access the iterated over values. In
the case of the map, it's possible to then access nested properties such as
`each.value.name`.

```tf
locals {
  bucket_names = set(["my-bucket-one", "my-bucket-two"])
  buckets = {
    three = { name = "my-bucket-three" },
    four = { name = "my-bucket-four" }
  }
}

resource "aws_s3_bucket" "buckets_set" {
  for_each = local.bucket_names

  bucket_name = each.value
}

resource "aws_s3_bucket" "buckets_map" {
  for_each = local.buckets

  bucket_name = each.value.name
}
```

When you define resources in this way, you can access properties via syntax like
`aws_s3_bucket.buckets_map["three"]`.

### `count`

If requirements are as simple as just creating _x_ number of resources, then
Terraform's `count` meta argument is the one for you. This allows you to say "I
want to create 10 S3 buckets", and make use of the count index (zero-indexed) to
build up unique names. For an example, see the snippet below which'll create S3
buckets names `my-bucket-1` through to `my-bucket-10`.

```tf
locals {
  number_of_buckets = 10
}

resource "aws_s3_bucket" "buckets" {
  count = local.number_of_buckets

  bucket_name = "my-bucket-${count.index + 1}"
}
```

When you define resources in this way, you can access properties via the syntax
`aws_s3_bucket.buckets_map[0]`.

## Summary

So, what's my overall view on this?

It's great that CloudFormation now supports the dynamic creation of resources
from a list of items. I'm sure that I'm not the only person who's been waiting
for this for a long time. But unfortunately I think that's about as far as my
excitement goes. Whilst functionally it does solve the problem, it just feels a
bit messy. I don't think that's down to any fault of the AWS service team, nor
suggestions made by the community, but rather a limitation of having to
implement it into something YAML and JSON compatible.

To me the Terraform implementation is cleaner and easier to read. For this
reason, I'd still recommend that over CloudFormation if you're going to be
defining lots of resources dynamically.

That's all for now. I promise not to take so long until I next publish
something, I've got a few ideas for services I'd like to explore!
